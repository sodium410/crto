**What's included**:

2. Free examinations -- as many exam attempts  
3. Lifetime access - course updates at no extra cost

**Launching the exam**:  
simply click on Red Team Operator Exam lesson in hte course menu  

**The exam scenario**:  
The instruction panel of the exam lab will present you with an operational objective  
that you must aim to achieve; and the rules of engagement which will detail any restrictions such as off-limit hosts, etc.  
You will fail the exam if you generate an alert on an off-limit host, even if you achieve the operational objective.  

The resources panel will allow you to access your Attacker Desktop and a 'foothold' machine  
on the internal network from which you may start the engagement.  
This is an assume-breach scenario where you will not have a Beacon pre-running, but access to this machine to run one manually.  
This may require you to bypass host-based defences first.  

**Exam scoring**:  maximum score possible is 100 and the minimum score required to pass is **85**.  

Achieving the **operational objective is worth 50 points**, so it is not possible  
to obtain a passing score without achieving the objective that was presented to you.  

The remaining **50 points are awarded based on your OPSEC discipline**.  
It is not enough to simply achieve the objective - how you do it matters.  
Performing 'perfect' OPSEC will net you all 50 points and the associated bragging rights.  
OPSEC 'failures', such as getting detected by anti-virus, will reduce your total OPSEC score.  

You will fail the exam if your OPSEC score drops too low, even if you achieve the objective.  

**Criteria**  
Your OPSEC is assessed based on the following high-level criteria:  
Blocked code execution by security controls like Defender and AppLocker.  
Outbound network connections from unusual processes.  
Default Cobalt Strike indicators including named pipe names and process injection techniques.  
Suspicious lateral movement indicators.  
Suspicious handles to LSASS.  
Disabling security controls like Defender and the Windows firewall.  

**Time Limits**:  
You are permitted to run the exam lab for a total of 48 hours and as with the other labs,  
your remaining time is displayed at the bottom of the instructions panel.  
Should you wish to take an extended break, click on Exit Lab > Save Process And Exit in the upper-right.  
However, you should not rely on this feature to preserve your running Beacons, particularly those in a P2P chain.  
Make sure you have proper persistence setup as you would in the real world.  

You have a total calendar time limit of 7 days to complete and submit your exam for grading.  
After 7 days, the exam is destroyed and all progress lost.
